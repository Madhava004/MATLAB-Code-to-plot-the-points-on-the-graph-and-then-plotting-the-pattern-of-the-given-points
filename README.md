# PLOTTING THE POINTS ON THE MATLAB PLOT AND DRAWING THE CURVE
The below are the points which are to be plotted on the curves

and we need the plot in the below fashion, what we cando is that we can apply the above code in order to get the plot.....

When we apply the code the below are the results

the above results might not be the correct results while comparing to the the model graph , we can take more and more results and code it with the sameone so that we can achieve our goal.....
